## Description 
This EIP specifies a hard-fork activation protocol and the necessary implementation
details. For the sake of presentation the description is formulated in terms for switching
from Ergo Protocol v1 (v3.x releases) to Ergo Protocol v2 (v4.x releases), hereinafter
called EP1 to EP2. However, the protocol and activation process are general enough to be
repeated in future if the need arises.

## Background And Motivation

Ergo is designed to support consensus protocol evolution via soft-fork. Soft-forkability
is already implemented in EP1. However, some protocol changes require hard-fork, which is
a significant event is the network lifecycle. Therefore, it is especially important to
have clear, transparent, predictable, safe and well understood hard-fork activation
process.
The following sections describe the process using switch from EP1 to EP2 as an example.

## Changes in EP2

### Change from AOTC to JITC
JIT costing (JITC pronounced "jitsy") can only be activated via hard-fork. It is not
possible to ensure that JITC always produces the same costs as AOTC by changing CostTable
parameters. This is because JITC is accurately accumulates the actual operations' cost and
AOTC is approximating both data sizes and speculating on potential costs in case of
branching logic. Please see detailed description of the changes in related [EIP8](eip-0008.md)

## Implementation of the Hard-Fork on Ergo network

The activation is performed in two phases. The goal of the first phase is to collect
votes, select starting block for a hard-fork and perform safe switch. The second phase is
dedicated to code cleanup and optimizations enabled by the hard-fork. This is optional
and some verifiers may opt to not do this, however this is part of the whole transition.

### Phase 1: Release v4.0.0.
This phase consists of the following steps, which are described in subsections:
1) voting until consensus on `HFVoted` status is achieved and `HFBlock` is defined,
waiting for `HFBlock` while following EP1
3) switching to EP2 starting from `HFBlock`

#### Selection of hard-forking block

In this first HF release both EP1 and EP2 code will be available. EP1 will be
operational until HF voting is finished and HF switch is performed. The full nodes vote
for HF by running v4.0.0 release, which behaves as v3.x, but imply voting. Every node can check the voting
status using Block Extension section. Once the necessary voting threshold is achieved
(`HFVoted` status is reached) in an epoch we know enough mining nodes upgraded and are running v4.0.0 release. 
We therefore can define the first block of the next epoch as the first hard-forked
block. We will refer to it as `HFBlock`.
  
##### Example: AOTC to JITC switch

It is important to ensure that JITC is functionally equivalent to AOTC for all the
blocks in `[1 .. HFBlock-1]` range. Here functional equivalence means that for each script
both AOTC and JITC should evaluate to the same result.
This property is necessary to remove the old v3.x ErgoTree interpreter and perform the
validation of historical blocks using the JITC interpreter alone. Since the history is
immutable, it is enough to check the equivalence by running both v3.x interpreter and
JITC on all the blocks up until `HFBlock`.

Thus, all v4.0.0 nodes will run JITC interpreter in parallel with AOTC and compare the
results. If at any time the script results are different, then AOTC result is used in
the consensus and the problematic transaction is logged. In addition the _voting
is blocked_, by the node. If AOTC validates the problematic transaction it still should
be added to the blockchain to support current consensus among v4.0.0 and older nodes. 
This will lead to all v4.0.0 nodes stop voting, thus preventing the HF switch. 

If voting is blocked (which is exceptional case), then a fix in JITC is required, so new
v4.0.1 release should be create and the HF process should start from scratch.

If voting is not blocked and `HFVoted` network status is achieved, then majority of
nodes are running the latest v4.x version. In this case the validation of the first block after
`HFVoted` (let's call it `HFVotedBlock`) require both AOTC and JITC have strictly the
same result. Transactions which invalidate this property should be rejected by all
v4.0.0 nodes (which are now the majority). This will ensure that in the block range
`[HFVotedBlock .. HFBlock]` AOTC and JITC are functionally equivalent.
   
  
#### Switching EP1 to EP2

When voting is not blocked, `HFVoted` status is achieved and `HFBlock` is selected then
all the v4.0.0 nodes need to switch from EP1 to EP2 starting from `HFBlock`.
This switch is implemented as `if` statements in the block validation code of v4.0.0
release.

Thus, starting from `HFBlock`, EP2 is used for all new block validation and EP1 is
turned-off (the code is not executed) and the network is operating according to a new
consensus (Ergo Protocol v2).
  
##### Example: AOTC to JITC switch
Now, because the v2 consensus is based on JITC there is an opportunity to fix bugs and
add new features to ErgoTree, which are all enabled starting from `HFBlock`. 

NOTE, both fixes and new features should keep backward compatibility of applications in
mind.

The fixes in JITC for v2 protocol, however, may be not compatible with v1 protocol. 
This will require JITC interpreter to have an internal branching logic having both
versions of the protocol. Thus, JITC v4.0.0 will process historical blocks according to
Ergo Protocol v1 and starting from `HFBlock` as Ergo Protocol v2. This will ensure, that
each v4.x release will successfully validate all historical blocks.
  
### Phase 2: Release v4.0.x (removing AOTC)

This version can be released after `HFBlock` and should include code supporting
ErgoProtocol v1 and v2. The main goal of this release is to remove unnecessary code to
simplify reference implementation.

##### Example: AOTC to JITC switch 

v4.0.x version can be released after `HFBlock` and should include JITC supporting
ErgoProtocol v1 and v2. The main goal of this release is to remove  v3.x AOTC ErgoTree
interpreter from the code to simplify reference implementation.

Update of the node to v4.0.1 shouldn't require node re-sync. For new nodes joining the
network, v4.0.1 will use JITC to validate both historical and new blocks. This is
possible since AOTC is conservative/pessimistic in estimating actual script costs. Thus,
JITC can relax script costs 2-3x so that all the historical blocks which are valid under
AOTC can also be valid under JITC. Thus, JITC will never invalidate historical blocks
due to costing and other invalidation reasons were prevented on the Phase 1 (by checking
functional equivalence).

Together with removed AOTC code, the HF switching condition can be simplified. Starting
from v4.0.1 release it can be based on using the known `HFBlock` constant in the code.
Switching based on hard-fork voting and `HFVoted` status is no-longer necessary and can
be disabled. The HF activation code itself, however, can be reused in the next HF voting
and activation.
