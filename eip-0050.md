Sigma 6.0
=========

This EIP contains proposed changes for Ergo contractual layer, called Sigma. These changes are based on found issues 
in the current version of Sigma, as well as feedback got from users, i.e. Ergo ecosystem developers.


Activation 
----------

Rule 1011 should be replaced with another one, likely with the same rule but under different id.

How to add a new method
-----------------------

Here are instructions on how to add a new method to existing types (as 6.0 is heavily about adding new methods).

Implementation:

* Checkout new branch based on "v6.0.0" branch

* Find appropriate type (e.g. *SBigInt*) to add a desirable method (e.g. *nbits*)

* Add method description there and add description handle to *getMethods()* in a class \*Methods corresponding to the type (*SBigIntMethods* in our example), add *method_eval* to be used via reflection in the compiler

* Add method implementation to corresponding type in *SigmaDsl.scala* 


* Add method evaluation to *ErgoTreeEvaluator* interface and its instantiation *CErgoTreeEvaluator*

* Add new method to reflection-related descriptions in *ReflectionData* (needed for compiler mostly?)

* Add pattern matching in GraphBuilding.scala to the compiler to get support for the new method in ErgoScript, e.g.
```
case Select(obj, SBigIntMethods.ToNBits.name, _) if obj.tpe == SBigInt && VersionContext.current.isV6SoftForkActivated =>
```

* Add new method to *SigmaDslUnit.scala* / *SigmaDslImpl.scala* (needed for compiler only)


Tests:


* Add compilation test in *TestingInterpreterSpecification*

* Add roundtrip test in *MethodCallSerializerSpecification*

* Add evaluation test (see "nbits evaluation" test)
