Sigma 6.0
=========

Motivation 
----------

Currently Sigma's 


Activation 
----------

Rule 1011 should be replaced with another one, likely the same but with other id.

Features Set 
------------

* *.validatePoW* method of *Header* type to validate Autolykos2 proof of work done on header 

issue: [https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/issues/958](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/issues/958)

* implement conversion from Long-encoded nBits representation to BigInt (long.fromNBits method) and to nBits from BitInt (bigInt.toNBits method)

How to add a new method
-----------------------

Here are instructions on how to add a (as 6.0 is heavily about adding new methods).

Implementation:

* Checkout new branch based on "v6.0.0" branch

* Find appropriate type (e.g. *SBigInt*) to add a desirable method (e.g. *nbits*)

* Add method description there and add description handle to *getMethods()* in a class \*Methods corresponding to the type (*SBigIntMethods* in our example), add *method_eval* to be used via reflection in the compiler

* Add method implementation to corresponding type in *SigmaDsl.scala* 

* Add method evaluation to *ErgoTreeEvaluator* interface and its instantiation *CErgoTreeEvaluator*

* Add new method to reflection-related descriptions in *ReflectionData* (needed for compiler mostly?)

* Add pattern matching to the compiler to get support for the new method in ErgoScript, e.g.
```
case Select(obj, SBigIntMethods.ToNBits.name, _) if obj.tpe == SBigInt && VersionContext.current.isV6SoftForkActivated =>
```

* Add new method to *SigmaDslUnit.scala* / *SigmaDslImpl.scala* (needed for compiler only)


Tests:


* Add compilation test in *TestingInterpreterSpecification*

* Add roundtrip test in *MethodCallSerializer*
