## Description 

This EIP defines a way for wallet applications, dApps and users to verify tokens. The EIP is meant to be updated regularly when new tokens of value or verification 
services are added.

## Motivation 

Ergo tokens can hold a certain value, best-known examples are the SigUSD and SigRSV tokens in use by the SigmaUSD stablecoin protocol. 
Tokens can be minted by every user, with a name and description free to choose. This means everyone can mint new tokens named "SigUSD", which bears a problem for 
end-users to decide if a token they received is genuine or not.

## Ergo tokens background

[See EIP-4](eip-0004.md): Ergo supports custom tokens as first-class citizens. A transaction can create out-of-thin-air tokens in its outputs if the token 
identifier is equal to the identifier of the first input box of the transaction.
As the box identifier is cryptographically unique, there's no chance to have the second token with the same identifier while the hash function being used 
is collision-resistant. 

In order to verify the authenticity of a token, the unique identifier of a token and its name is needed to check.

## Token authenticity verification algorithm

The verification algorithm relies on a list of blocked tokens and a list of genuine tokens that can have a unique name.
The token to test is checked as follows:
- Is the token id listed in verified tokens? If yes, the token is **verified**.
- Is the token id listed in blocked tokens? If yes, the token is **blocked**.
- Is the token id not listed, but its name is the name of a verified token with unique name? If yes, the token is **suspicious**.
- If nothing applies, the token authenticity is **unknown**.

## Recommended approach for applications showing tokens to end-users

### Verified tokens 
Applications should add a verification sign next to a token which is listed in the following [genuine tokens list](#genuine-tokens).

### Suspicious tokens
In order to protect end-users for confusion, it is decided for some tokens in the [genuine tokens list](#genuine-tokens) that the verbose name should be 
unique and should not be used by other tokens. 
This is not enforced by Ergo protocol, so applications should check if a token uses a unique name from the list and add a warning sign when needed.

### Blocked tokens
Applications should show a warning sign next to tokens identified to be harmful or impersonating other tokens.

## REST API services and OpenAPI specification

The algorithm outlined before can be implemented in dApps/wallet applications, but this needs constant maintenance and slow updates to the users, so 
REST API services are preferable to be used. Since verifying and blocking tokens means responsibility and providers of such services are free to add
tokens to their lists as they wish, users should have the choice which service they want to use and what provider they trust the most. To give
users a choice to switch and providers the ability to set up own services, an 
[OpenAPI specification for a token verification service](eip-0021/openapi.yaml) 
is attached to this EIP. API service providers must implement it completely.

## Token lists

### Process to add tokens to this list

As outlined before, this list should only hold tokens of value. This means that mainly tokens of financial value can be added. Before opening a PR to add your token to
this list, ask yourself if your token is interesting for scammers. When the answer is no, the token should probably not added to this list.
On rare occasions, tokens of a certain intrinsic value to the community could be added as well when there was a community vote with significant community participation.
Applications and REST API service providers can add own tokens to their list, but should be open about it. As Ergo is neutral, the list defined here should be 
compact and the smallest common denominator.
