## Description
This EIP proposes a new extension to the transaction format to support Atomic Transaction
DAGs (ATDs) in the Ergo blockchain, where DAG refers to Directed Acyclic Graph. ATDs
ensure that a series of chained transactions are either all included in a block or none
are included, thus preserving the integrity and preventing undesirable (for DApps and L2
protocols) states on the blockchain.

## Background And Motivation

When a transaction is sent to the Ergo node, it is first placed into a mempool
queue. From the mempool, the node can pick up transactions to include in the next block.
Chained transactions (or transaction chains) are sequences where the outputs (UTXOs) of
one transaction are immediately consumed by the next transaction in the sequence, forming
a chain. 

Although many transactions can be chained together as long as the input UTXOs (called
Boxes in Ergo) are not yet spent, there is a problem: the default mempool procedure can
break the chain by including only part of it in the next block. This can create
undesirable states for some protocols.

The solution is to introduce Atomic Transaction DAGs (ATDs), which extend the unconfirmed
transaction data structure to include special markers, ensuring that miners either include
all chained transactions in a block or none at all. This will preserve the integrity of
the transaction chains and ensure consistent states on the blockchain. 

## Example Use Cases

- **Complex DApps**: Decentralized applications (DApps) that rely on multi-step
  transactions can ensure atomic execution, preventing intermediate states that could lead
  to vulnerabilities or inconsistent data.
- **Batch Payments**: Businesses or services that need to process batch payments can use
  ATDs to ensure all payments in the batch are processed together. This also includes the
  case when the batched transaction are independent but should be processed together, in
  which case ADT markings connect them together.
- **Cross-Chain Operations**: Ensuring atomicity in transactions that interact with
  multiple blockchains or off-chain components.
- **DeFi Protocols**: Transactions across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols can be
  DAGed to ensure atomic execution, enhancing security and reliability. 
  Example: 1) Withdraw from SigUSD; b) Swap on DEX; c) Send to Rosen.
- **Simplified DApp design**: DApps can simplify their design by chaining multiple
  transactions together without worrying about partial execution.
- **Easier Implementation of L2 Protocols**: Layer 2 protocols can use ATDs to ensure
  atomic execution of their transactions, simplifying the implementation and improving
  security.
- **Improved User Experience**: Integration with wallets like Nautilus will allow DApps to use
  the mempool to improve user experience with transaction chaining and instant balance
  updates.

## Implementation Design

Ergo node can be configured to support ATDs (after updating the software) to
recognize and process the new ATDs transaction markers. The process involves:

1. **Mempool Handling**: Collecting all transactions belonging to the same DAG from the
   mempool.
2. **DAG Verification**: Ensuring that the DAG is complete and no transactions are
   missing.
3. **Atomic Inclusion**: Scheduling the inclusion of the entire DAG into the next block,
   ensuring atomicity.

DApps can selectively send ATDs to Ergo nodes that announce their support for this feature,
ensuring that their transactions are processed atomically.

## Changes in Ergo Node

To support Atomic Transaction DAGs (ATDs), modifications are required in the Ergo node,
specifically in the handling of the mempool and the UnconfirmedTransaction class. The
changes are as follows:

### UnconfirmedTransaction Class

The UnconfirmedTransaction class needs to be extended with optional fields to support
chaining of transactions. These fields include:

- `chainId`: This is an identifier of the first transaction in the chain. It is obtained
  by topologically ordering the transactions in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and using
  id of the first transaction.
- `indexInChain`: This is the index of the UnconfirmedTransaction in the chain.
- `numTransactions`: This is the total number of transactions in the DAG.

### Mempool Handling

The mempool handling process needs to be updated to support ATDs. 

### Support in DApps 

When a DApp wants to submit a new ATD to the blockchain, it should:

- Topologically order the DAG into a list of transactions.
- Use the `id` of the first transaction as the `chainId`.
- Pair each transaction with the chaining fields.
- Post each transaction individually to the node API endpoint along with the chaining
  fields.

All of this implementation details can be encapsulated in Ergo SDKs and hidden from dApp
developers.

### New API Endpoints

To facilitate interaction with DApps, new API endpoints need to be created.  The
operations supported should include posting new ATDs, retrieving existing ones, looking up
ATDs by their identifiers, searching for ATDs based on certain criteria, and replacing
existing ATDs.

## Security Considerations

- **DAG Integrity**: Ensuring that all transactions in a DAG are valid and that the
  DAG is not tampered with.
- **Mempool Management**: Preventing mempool spam or abuse by enforcing limits on the
  number of transactions in a DAG. 
- **Protocol Updates**: While this proposal doesn't require protocol update, in the future 
    it may be possible to update the L1 protocol to support ATDs which will give better
    security guarantees to the DApps.

### Raw

The UnconfirmedTransaction class needs to be extended with optional fields to support chaining of transactions. These fields include:  
chainId: This is an identifier of the first transaction in the chain. It is obtained by topologically ordering the transactions in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
indexInChain: This is the index of the UnconfirmedTransaction in the chain.
numTransactions: This is the total number of transactions in the DAG.

To facilitate interaction with DApps, new API endpoints need to be created. These endpoints should be capable of interacting with ATDs in the mempool. The operations supported should include posting new ATDs, retrieving existing ones, looking up ATDs by their identifiers, searching for ATDs based on certain criteria, and replacing existing ATDs.

By implementing these changes, Ergo nodes will be able to support ATDs, thereby enhancing the atomicity of transaction execution and improving the overall integrity and consistency of states on the blockchain.

Implementation ATCs on the level of mempools is rather straighforward. All we need to do
is to add optional fields to the UnconfirmedTransaction class (chaining fields):
- chainId: ModifierId  - id of the first transaction in the chain obtained by
  topologically ordering DAG's transactions
- indexInChain: Int - index of the UnconfirmedTransaction in the chain
- numTransactions: Int - number of transaction in the DAG.

When DApp wants to submit a new ATD to the blockchain, it performs the following steps:
- topologically order DAG into list of transactions
- use `id` of the first transaction as `chainId`
- pair each transaction with chaining fields
- post each transaction individually to node API endpoint together with chaining fields

To support interaction with dApps, a set of new endpoints should be created which can
interact with ATDs in the mempool (post, get, lookup, search, replace etc.)
