## Motivation

This specification defines a standardized way of implementing and interacting with stealth addresses on the Ergo blockchain.

Stealth addresses enable recipients of a payment to remain anonymous when receiving funds thus providing financial privacy should an actor desire it.

## Scenario

An actor, `Receiver`, wishes to receive a stealth payment so they generate a public address and share it.

An actor, `Sender`, wishes to make a stealth payment to `Receiver` so they create a box protected by a "one-time-secret" generated from the `Receiver`s public address. Due to the method of generation this box will be spendable by `Receiver` and cannot be linked to the `Receiver`s public address they shared.

## Stealth address specification

The implemention suggested in this EIP was posted by `scalahub` in a thread on `ergoforum.org` [[1]](#1) and is outlined below.

**Script protecting stealth boxes:**

```scala
{
    // ===== Contract Information ===== //
    // Name: EIP-0041 Stealth address contract
    // Version: 1.0.0
    val gr = SELF.R4[GroupElement].get
    val gy = SELF.R5[GroupElement].get
    val ur = SELF.R6[GroupElement].get
    val uy = SELF.R7[GroupElement].get

    proveDHTuple(gr,gy,ur,uy)
}
```

**Script ErgoTree:**

```

```

**Generation of stealth box registers [[5]](#5):**

```typescript
const g = new EC("secp256k1").g; // group element generator
const u = receiverPublicAddress;
const r = BigInt(rand(32));
const y = BigInt(rand(32));
const gr = g.mul(r); // gr = g^r = R4
const gy = g.mul(y); // gy = g^y = R5
const ur = u.mul(r); // ur = u^r = R6
const uy = u.mul(y); // uy = u^y = R7
```

**Box register declarations:**

- Register `R4`
  - Type: `SConstant[SGroupElement]`
  - Value: gr = g^r
- Register `R5`
  - Type: `SConstant[SGroupElement]`
  - Value: gy = g^y
- Register `R6`
  - Type: `SConstant[SGroupElement]`
  - Value: ur = u^r
- Register `R7`
  - Type: `SConstant[SGroupElement]`
  - Value: uy = u^y

> üìù As discussed in the `ergoforum` discussion [[1]](#1) this register declaration is larger in size than that originally proposed by `kushti` but possesses the useful property that it could look like a legitimate use-case.

## `Receiver`s public address and wallets

Leaning on deterministically generated wallet addresses [[6]](#6) enables stealth boxes to be retreived following a fresh wallet restore but raises a problem. When a user shares such a public address and wishes to receive stealth payments how do wallets determine they are requesting a stealth payment - the address will appear to be a regular P2PK address.

Requiring `Sender` to manually perform special actions when sending a stealth payment in their wallet introduces the possibility of (in addition to other issues):

1. `Sender` uses a regular payment exposing a transaction that `Receiver` wanted to remain private
2. Introduces friction when making payments, possiblily reducing conversions
3. Less user friendly, `Sender` as a non-technical user might not know about stealth payments

Ideally when `Sender` is creating a stealth transaction in their wallet the UX flow should remain the same as a regular transaction, the fact that the `Receiver` is requesting a stealth payment should be opaque to the `Sender` when making the payment. To achieve this we could encode a "payment type" in the public address so wallets can detect the `Receiver` is requesting a specific type of payment and construct the transaction accordingly, similar to network and address type prefixes but only for supporting wallets.

This could extend in the future to more non-interactive custom payment types, not just stealth payments.

**Encoding**

Encoding of the public key to include custom payment requests could be implemented as follows:

| Field             | Type     | Description                                                              |
|-------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Magic Byte Prefix | byte     | Magic byte indiciating `Receiver` is requesting a custom transaction     |
| Custom Tx Type    | byte     | Enum defining the type of custom transaction `Receiver` is requesting    |
| Network Address   | byte[]   | Standard network encoded p2pk address                                    |

**Constructing the public address for a `Receiver` requesting a stealth payment**

```ts
enum CustomTxType {
    Stealth = 0x0,
    // More in future?
}

const magicBytePrefix = 0xCE // arbitrarily chosen for now
const customTxType = CustomTxType.Stealth
const publicShareableAddress = [magicBytePrefix, customTxType] + normalP2PKNetworkAddress

// publicShareableAddress is shared to social media, etc to receive payments
```

**Possible wallet implementation**

As mentioned previously, when `Sender` is making a payment to `Receiver` ideally their user journey would remain the same with the wallet handling the custom transaction type.

`Sender` inputs `Receiver`s public address encoded as above and a wallet might handle it in the following manner:

```ts
enum CustomTxType {
    Stealth = 0x0
}

const magicBytePrefix = 0xCE
const receiverPublicAddress = new UInt8([/** receivers pub key **/])

if (receiverPublicAddress[0] === magicBytePrefix) {
    const customTxType = receiverPublicAddress[1] as CustomTxType
    const networkEncodedPubKey = receiverPublicAddress.slice(2)

    handleCustomTx(customTxType, networkEncodedPubKey)
} else {
    handleNormalTx(receiverPublicAddress) // handle making payment as normal
}
```
