## Description
This EIP defines a data format for Reduced Transaction which can be used:
- to enable interoperation between an online dApp and a wallet app for creating, signing and sending Ergo transactions
- to serialize reduced transaction to QR code for scanning by a wallet app
- to serialize reduced transaction to JSON for using in Ergo node API

## Background And Motivation

In the Ergo's eUTXO model a box can be protected by an arbitrary complex
contract (aka spending condition) and the spending transaction should satisfy
that condition by adding required context variables, creating expected number of
outputs with specific registers etc. i.e. a special data structure called
`Context`. 

Say we want to sign a new transaction. The Context should be created for each input of the
transaction and then passed to the Prover which will generate a signature for that input.
See [general overview of signing and
verification](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter#sigma-language-background)
process in Ergo for details.

In general, the Context represents the current state of the blockchain and includes
current header, previous 10 headers, current height etc. This data can be retrieved from
blockchain nodes. This is possible on Hot Wallet device - a device with a network
connection, but is not possible on [Cold Wallet](eip-0019.md) device (where there is no
network connection).

At the same time the prover (which generates a signature for the transaction) need to know
both the Context data _and_ the private keys, which are stored on the Cold Wallet device,
and so the Prover must run on the Cold Wallet device.

And that is the problem, we cannot transfer unsigned transaction along with all the
contexts for each input to the Cold Wallet via QR codes. QR codes have limit of 4K bytes
on the maximum size of serialized data. Even simplest transactions when serialized with
required Contexts will exceed this limit.

## Reduced Transaction data

Here we introduce a new data structure and serialization format called
`ReducedTransaction`.

```
ReducedTransaction:
  - unsignedTx: UnsignedTransaction
  - reducedInputs: Seq[ReducedInputData]
  - txCost: Int

UnsignedTransaction:
  - inputs: Seq[UnsignedInput],
  - dataInputs: Seq[DataInput],
  - outputCandidates: Seq[ErgoBoxCandidate]

UnsignedInput:
  - boxId: BoxId
  - extension: ContextExtension

ReducedInputData:
- reductionResult: ReductionResult

ReductionResult:
  - value: SigmaBoolean
  - cost: Long
```

Thus, the `ReducedTransaction` instance contains unsigned transaction augmented with
one `ReductionResult` for each `UnsignedInput`.

Note that `UnsignedInput` object doesn't contain `ergoTree`, `additionalTokens`,
`additionalRegisters` and other properties of
[ErgoBox](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/4533b6a7ae86ada20f3136c70a67a920ae7c43e1/sigmastate/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/ErgoBox.scala#L51)
which are necessary to perform
[ErgoTree](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/1a1b003bc30e490d8b5af30e7670227e54e682c2/sigmastate/src/main/scala/sigmastate/Values.scala#L1014)
reduction and which are part of the
[Context](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/e5127f6743db824f7280881cd5c4ecd336075e2f/sigmastate/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/ErgoLikeContext.scala#L51)
data structure required by the
[prove](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/f24833d8d4572d77e4a93e5b69360335cb2d7dc1/sigmastate/src/main/scala/sigmastate/interpreter/ProverInterpreter.scala#L104)
method to generate a proof (aka signature).

This is because those context data is not required to generate proof
once ErgoTree is reduced to ReductionResult containing sigma proposition.

## Data Formats

### ReducedTransaction

ReducedTransaction is serialized to bytes array in the format described below. Note, field
names are not serialized.

| Field Name      | Format              | Description                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `messageSize`   | `VLQ(UInt)`         | Number of bytes in the messageToSign of the transaction |
| `messageToSign` | `Bytes`             | serialized bytes of the unsignedTx.messageToSign  |
| `reducedInputs` | `ReductionResult*` | serialized reduced inputs                         |
| `txCost`        | `VLQ(UInt)`        | transaction cost according to the prover          |

Note, the number of reduced inputs is serialized as part of the `messageToSign`.

### ReductionResult

Reduction result is obtained for each input of the original unsigned transaction.

| Field Name | Format         | Description                                                         |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `value`    | `SigmaBoolean` | serialized sigma proposition, see section 5.2.2 in [2](#references) |
| `cost`     | `VLQ(ULong)`   | cost accumulated during reduction of the input's ErgoTree           |

## Implementation in Appkit

ReducedTransaction is represented in Appkit as a
[class](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/blob/1d7503595eab13f8762efa36c426ad61dbfd58ce/lib-impl/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/impl/ReducedTransactionImpl.java)
which can be [serialized to bytes array](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/blob/c89e5e3d82d6e51f206c9415ecfe48d8830540dc/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/AppkitProvingInterpreter.scala#L342).
