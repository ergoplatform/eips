## Motivation 

Act of exchange without trusted parties is a most basic primitive for decentralized finance on top of blockchains. Thus contracts for that were introduced early, and basic single-chain swap contract was introduced early in the [ErgoScript whitepaper](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoScript.pdf). Then a lot of other order contracts appeared: with partial filling, buyback guarantee and so on. What is good for traders in decentralized worlds, such contracts are usually composable. 
While swap order contracts allows for orderbook-based decentralized exchanges (DEXes), now popular AMM-based DEXes (where AMM stands for Automated Market Maker) are also possible on Ergo. 
Interestingly, unlike other known blockchains, thanks to the extended UTXO model, liquidity pool contracts for AMM-based DEXes can be combined with order contracts (for orderbook-based DEXes). This gives unique possibility to have shared liquidity among different types of exchanges on top of the Ergo blockchain. 

This PR provides a description of the Automated Decentralized Exchange protocol on top of the Ergo.

## Order-book DEX

Orders are waiting for another orders to be matched, or for a refund command. There're the following three types of orders — "buy" (i.e. buy tokens with ERG), "sell" (i.e. sell tokens for ERG), or "swap" (buy non-ERG tokens with other non-ERG tokens) orders. Order-book DEX has the advantage of working best for those pairs with high liquidity.

### Atomic orders

Atomic orders can only be executed completely. Such orders can be either be aggregated by the ErgoDEX client so that users can choose from them or matched with partial orders which will be defined next.

#### Buy order [ERG -> Token]

```scala
{
    val quoteId     = SELF.R4[Coll[Byte]].get // R4 - quote tokenId
    val price       = SELF.R5[Long].get       // R5 - price per token
    val feePerToken = SELF.R6[Long].get       // R6 - fee per token

    val maybeRewardBox           = OUTPUTS(0)
    val isValidRewardProposition = maybeRewardBox.propositionBytes == pk.propBytes
    val maybeRewardToken         = maybeRewardBox.tokens(0)

    val rewardTokens =
        if (isValidRewardProposition && maybeRewardToken._1 == quoteId) maybeRewardToken._2
        else 0L

    val feeCharged    = rewardTokens * feePerToken
    val isValidReward = (SELF.value.toBigInt - feeCharged) <= rewardTokens * price

    sigmaProp(pk || isValidReward)
}
```

#### Sell order [Token -> ERG]

```scala
{
    val price       = SELF.R5[Long].get       // R5 - price per token
    val feePerToken = SELF.R6[Long].get       // R6 - fee per token

    val maybeRewardBox           = OUTPUTS(0)
    val isValidRewardProposition = maybeRewardBox.propositionBytes == pk.propBytes

    val ergs0 = SELF.value
    val ergs1 =
        if (isValidRewardProposition) maybeRewardBox.value
        else 0L

    val deltaErgs = ergs1 - ergs0

    val soldTokens = SELF.tokens(0)._2

    val feeCharged    = soldTokens * feePerToken
    val isValidReward = deltaErgs.toBigInt >= soldTokens.toBigInt * price - feeCharged

    sigmaProp(pk || isValidReward)
}
```

#### Swap [TokenX -> TokenY]
    
```scala
{
    val quoteAssetId = SELF.R4[Coll[Byte]].get // R4 - quote asset ID
    val price        = SELF.R5[Long].get       // R5 - price per token
    val feePerToken  = SELF.R6[Long].get       // R6 - fee per quote token

    val maybeRewardBox           = OUTPUTS(0)
    val maybeOutputQuoteAsset    = maybeRewardBox.tokens(0)
    val isValidRewardProposition = maybeRewardBox.propositionBytes == pk.propBytes
    val isValidQuoteAsset        = maybeOutputQuoteAsset._1 == quoteAssetId

    val ergs0 = SELF.value
    val ergs1 =
        if (isValidRewardProposition) maybeRewardBox.value
        else 0L

    val baseInput   = SELF.tokens(0)._2
    val quoteOutput =
        if (isValidRewardProposition && isValidQuoteAsset) maybeOutputQuoteAsset._2
        else 0L

    val deltaErgs = ergs0 - ergs1

    val isValidOutput = baseInput <= quoteOutput * price
    val isValidFee    = deltaErgs <= quoteOutput * feePerToken

    sigmaProp(pk || (isValidOutput && isValidFee))
}   
```

### Orders with partial filling support:

Partial orders are something more familiar to those who've ever used classical CEX'es. These orders can be partially executed so the best way to work with them is an order-book, where they can be aggregated, matched and executed by ErgoDEX bots.

#### Buy order [ERG -> Token]
    
```scala
{
    val quoteId     = SELF.R4[Coll[Byte]].get // R4 - quote tokenId
    val price       = SELF.R5[Long].get       // R5 - price per token
    val feePerToken = SELF.R6[Long].get       // R6 - fee per token

    val maybeRewardBox           = OUTPUTS(0)
    val isValidRewardProposition = maybeRewardBox.propositionBytes == pk.propBytes
    val maybeRewardToken         = maybeRewardBox.tokens(0)

    val rewardTokens =
        if (isValidRewardProposition && maybeRewardToken._1 == quoteId) maybeRewardToken._2
        else 0L

    val hasResidualBox             = OUTPUTS.size > 1
    val maybeResidualBox           = OUTPUTS(1)
    val isValidResidualProposition = maybeResidualBox.propositionBytes == SELF.propositionBytes
    val isValidResidualRegisters   =
        maybeResidualBox.R4[Coll[Byte]].get == quoteId &&
        maybeResidualBox.R5[Long].get       == price &&
        maybeResidualBox.R6[Long].get       == feePerToken

    val validResidualBoxExists = hasResidualBox && isValidResidualProposition && isValidResidualRegisters

    val leftErgs =
        if (validResidualBoxExists) maybeResidualBox.value
        else 0L

    val feeCharged       = rewardTokens * feePerToken
    val nanoErgsConsumed = SELF.value.toBigInt - feeCharged - leftErgs
    val isValidReward    = nanoErgsConsumed <= rewardTokens.toBigInt * price

    sigmaProp(pk || isValidReward)
}
```

#### Sell order [Token -> ERG]
    
```scala
{
    val quoteAsset  = SELF.tokens(0)
    val price       = SELF.R5[Long].get       // R5 - price per token
    val feePerToken = SELF.R6[Long].get       // R6 - fee per token

    val maybeRewardBox           = OUTPUTS(0)
    val isValidRewardProposition = maybeRewardBox.propositionBytes == pk.propBytes

    val ergs0 = SELF.value
    val ergs1 =
        if (isValidRewardProposition) maybeRewardBox.value
        else 0L

    val deltaErgs = ergs1 - ergs0

    val hasResidualBox             = OUTPUTS.size > 1
    val maybeResidualBox           = OUTPUTS(1)
    val maybeResidualAsset         = maybeResidualBox.tokens(0)
    val isValidResidualProposition = maybeResidualBox.propositionBytes == SELF.propositionBytes
    val isValidResidualAsset       = maybeResidualAsset._1 == quoteAsset._1
    val isValidResidualRegisters   =
        maybeResidualBox.R5[Long].get == price &&
        maybeResidualBox.R6[Long].get == feePerToken

    val validResidualBoxExists = hasResidualBox && isValidResidualProposition && isValidResidualAsset && isValidResidualRegisters

    val tokens0 = quoteAsset._2
    val tokens1 =
        if (validResidualBoxExists) maybeResidualAsset._2
        else 0L

    val soldTokens = tokens0 - tokens1

    val feeCharged    = soldTokens * feePerToken
    val isValidReward = deltaErgs.toBigInt >= soldTokens.toBigInt * price - feeCharged

    sigmaProp(pk || isValidReward)
} 
```

### On-chain matching vs Off-chain

It is not neccessary to publish orders on chain in order for them to be matched. ErgoDEX bots can synchronize orders off-chain, match them and only then execute in chained transactions. This approach allows to avoid committing cancelled orders on-chain.

## Automated Liquidity Pools

Unlike order-book based DEX which relies on an order-book to represent liquidity and determine prices AMM DEX uses an automated market maker mechanism to provide instant feedback on rates and slippage. AMM DEX suits best for pairs with low liquidity.

Each AMM liquidity pool is a trading venue for a pair of assets. In order to facilitate trades a liquidity pool accepts deposits of underlying assets proportional to their price rates. Whenever deposit happens a proportional amount of unique tokens known as liquidity tokens is minted. Minted liquidity tokens are distributed among liquidity providers proportional to their deposits. Liquidity providers can later exchange their liquidity tokens share for a proportional amount of underlying reserves. 

## Economics of Ergo AMM DEX

There are three types of economic agents in an AMM DEX ecosystem:
* DEXes (Parties which run DEX bots and UI)
* Liquidity providers (LPs)
* Traders

Each agent type benefits from using DEX in their own way
* DEXes are earning fees from traders' swaps in ERGs
* LPs benefit from protocol fees paid in tokens and accumulated in liquidity pools
* Traders benefit from DEX services they use

### Ergo AMM DEX Contracts [Arbitrary Pairs]

Ergo AMM DEX relies on two types of contracts:

- Pool contracts
- Swap contracts

#### Pool contracts

Pool contract ensures the following operations are performed according to protocol rules:

- Depositing. An amount of LP tokens taken from LP reserves is proportional to an amount of underlying assets deposited. `LP = min(X_deposited * LP_supply / X_reserved, Y_deposited * LP_supply / Y_reserved)`
- Redemption. Amounts of underlying assets redeemed are proportional to an amount of LP tokens returned. `X_redeemed = LP_returned * X_reserved / LP_supply`, `Y_redeemed = LP_returned * Y_reserved / LP_supply`
- Swap. Tokens are exchanged at a price corresponding to a relation of a pair’s reserve balances while preserving constant product constraint (`CP = X_reserved * Y_reserved`). Correct amount of protocol fees is paid (0.03% currently). `X_output = X_reserved * Y_input * 997 / (Y_reserved * 1000 + Y_input * 997)`

Variables:
- `X_deposited` - Amount of the first asset being deposited to a pool
- `Y_deposited` - Amount of the second asset being deposited to a pool
- `X_reserved` - Amount of the first asset locked in a pool
- `Y_reserved` - Amount of the second asset locked in a pool
- `LP_supply` - LP tokens circulating supply

#### Tracking pool identity

In order to preserve pool uniqueness a non-fungible token (NFT) is used. Then concrete pool can be identified by a unique NFT containing in pool UTXO.
Pool NFT is created at pool initialization stage. The pool bootstrapping contract ensures the NFT is issued while the main pool contract ensures its preservation along the whole lifecycle.

#### Liquidity pool bootstrapping

A liquidity pool is bootstrapped in two steps:

1. In order to track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves of a new pair a unique token called "LP token" must be issued. As soon as tokens can’t be re-issued on Ergo the whole LP emission has to be done at once.
2. Initial reserves of token pair and a remainder of LP tokens left after initial depositing are locked with the pool contract. Also pool NFT is issued. Thus the pool is created in an initial state. Correctness of the state can be checked off-chain at any time by querying the genesis transaction (i.e. the transaction which created the pool). This can be done easily using pool NFT pointing to the first input of that transaction. Note: Any unknown pool must be validated by a client before use, it's critical for security.

Off-chain pool validation rules:
1. `emission(NFT) == 1`
2. `emission(LP) == K - Bi`, where `K` is predefined total `LP` supply, `Bi` is the amount of LP tokens to be burned initially. Initial LP burning is required in order to address so called "Donation Attack" - an attack when the smallest fraction of LP token becomes so overpriced, that small LPs can't provide liquidity to the pool anymore.
3. `sqrt(GenesisBox.tokens[X] * GenesisBox.tokens[Y]) >= K - GenesisBox.tokens[LP]` - initial depositing is done according to `S = sqrt(X_deposited * Y_deposited)`, where `S` is initial LP reward.

```
                                               InitialInput#2 [X:N, Y:M]
 1.  Issue LP tokens                                       |
                                                           |
                    InitialInput#1 [LP:K]                  |
                        |           |                      |
 2a. Reward LP          |           |   2b. Create pool    |
                        |           |                      |
    LPRewardOut [LP:sqrt(N*M)]     Pool [NFT:1, LP:K-sqrt(N*M), X:N, Y:M]
```

{

}
```

#### Swap proxy-contract

Swap contract ensures a swap is executed fairly from a user's perspective. The contract checks that:
* Assets are swapped at actual price derived from pool reserves. `X_output = X_reserved * Y_input * fee_num / (Y_reserved * 1000 + Y_input * fee_num)`
* Fair amount of DEX fee held in ERGs. `F = X_output * F_per_token`
* A minimal amount of quote asset received as an output in order to prevent front-running attacks.

Once published swap contracts are tracked and executed by ErgoDEX bots automatically. Until a swap is executed it can be cancelled by a user who created it by simply spending the swap UTXO.

### Ergo AMM DEX Contracts [Ergo to Token]

The Ergo-to-token or the native-to-token (N2T) exchange is an exchange between Ergo's native token (nanoErgs) and some other token.
There are two approaches to create a N2T exchange:
1. Use a T2T (token-to-token) exchange, where one of the tokens maps to Ergs and have a separate dApp that exchanges Ergs to tokens at 1:1 rate.
2. Implement N2T directly in the exchange contract. Here we use this approach.

#### Pool contracts

The following is the modified pool contract representing a Liquidity Pool of the N2T AMM DEX.
As before, the pool contract ensures the following operations are performed according to protocol rules:

- Depositing. An amount of LP tokens taken from LP reserves is proportional to an amount of underlying assets deposited. `LP = min(X_deposited * LP_supply / X_reserved, Y_deposited * LP_supply / Y_reserved)`
- Redemption. Amounts of underlying assets redeemed are proportional to an amount of LP tokens returned. `X_redeemed = LP_returned * X_reserved / LP_supply`, `Y_redeemed = LP_returned * Y_reserved / LP_supply`
- Swap. Tokens are exchanged at a price corresponding to a relation of a pair’s reserve balances while preserving constant product constraint (`CP = X_reserved * Y_reserved`). Correct amount of protocol fees is paid (0.03% currently). `X_output = X_reserved * Y_input * 997 / (Y_reserved * 1000 + Y_input * 997)`

Variables:
- `X_deposited` - Amount of the first asset (nanoErgs) being deposited to the pool box
- `Y_deposited` - Amount of the second asset being deposited to the pool box
- `X_reserved` - Amount of the first asset (nanoErgs) locked in the pool box
- `Y_reserved` - Amount of the second asset locked in the pool box
- `LP_supply` - LP tokens circulating supply corresponding to the pool box

#### Schema of the pool UTXO

Section   | Description
----------|------------------------------------------------------
value     | Asset X reserves (nanoErgs)
tokens[0] | Pool NFT
tokens[1] | Locked LP tokens
tokens[2] | Asset Y reserves
R4[Long]  | Fee multiplier numerator (e.g. 0.3% fee -> 997 fee_num). This represents the *non-fee* part of the sold asset

#### Swap proxy-contract (N2T)

Swap contract ensures a swap is executed fairly from a user's perspective. The contract checks that:
* Assets are swapped at actual price derived from pool reserves. `X_output = X_reserved * Y_input * fee_num / (Y_reserved * 1000 + Y_input * fee_num)`
* Fair amount of DEX fee held in ERGs. `F = X_output * F_per_token`
* A minimal amount of quote asset received as an output in order to prevent front-running attacks.

Once published swap contracts are tracked and executed by ErgoDEX bots automatically.
Until a swap is executed, it can be cancelled by a user who created it by simply spending the swap UTXO.
